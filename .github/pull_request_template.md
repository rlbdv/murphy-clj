Thanks for your efforts -- please make sure each commit includes a

  Signed-off-by: Someone <someone@some.where>

line in the commit message that matches the "Author" line so that
we'll be able to include your work in the project.  Including this
header in your patches signifies that you are licensing your changes
under the terms described in the [SIGNED-OFF-BY
file](../SIGNED-OFF-BY).  If you like, git can can add the appropriate
pseudo-header for you via the `--signoff` argument to commit, amend,
etc.
